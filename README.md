# Viken Parikh — Personal Website

This repository contains my portfolio website at https://vikenparikh.github.io, built with Astro and based on the DevPortfolio template structure.

## Tech Stack

- Astro
- Tailwind CSS v4
- TypeScript-based site configuration

## Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Production Build

```bash
npm run build
```

The production output is generated in `dist/`.

## Verification

```bash
npm run check
```

This runs Astro diagnostics and catches schema/type issues before deployment.

## Personalization

Update profile content, skills, projects, and social links in `src/config.ts`.

## Auto-generated Projects

Projects are generated by `scripts/portfolio_builder.py` into `src/generated/projects.ts`.

- Build runs `npm run sync:projects` automatically before Astro build.
- Manual generation:

```bash
npm run sync:projects
```

Configure scanning and curation in `portfolio_builder.json`:

- `scan_paths`: directories to scan for repositories.
- `skip_projects`: directories always ignored during local scanning.
- `exclude_projects`: project names excluded from both local and GitHub fallback results.
- `preferred_projects`: priority ordering signal for top-ranking projects.
- `max_projects`: maximum projects emitted to `src/generated/projects.ts`.

The Projects section displays two groups:

- Top Projects: first six ranked projects.
- Other Projects: remaining generated projects.

If you want static project entries only, clear the generated file and define projects in `src/config.ts`.

## Deployment

GitHub Actions deploys the Astro `dist/` output to GitHub Pages via `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

The workflow also sets up Python because the build pipeline runs the project generator script.

## Troubleshooting

- If `npm run build` fails at project sync, run `python3 --version` and ensure Python 3.11+ is installed.
- If generated projects look noisy, update `exclude_projects` and `preferred_projects` in `portfolio_builder.json`.
- If GitHub Pages build fails, check the `Build with Astro` step logs first (sync runs there before Astro build).
